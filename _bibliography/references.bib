	abstract={Nonlocal (spatial-dispersion) effects in multilayered metamaterials composed
	of periodic stacks of alternating, deeply subwavelength dielectric layers are
	known to be negligibly weak. Counterintuitively, under certain critical
	conditions, weak nonlocality may build up strong boundary effects that are not
	captured by conventional (local) effective-medium models based on simple mixing
	formulas. Here, we show that this phenomenon can be fruitfully studied and
	understood in terms of error propagation in the iterated maps of the trace and
	anti-trace of the optical transfer matrix of the multilayer. Our approach
	effectively parameterizes these peculiar effects via remarkably simple and
	insightful closed-form expressions, which enable direct identification of the
	critical parameters and regimes. We also show how these boundary effects can be
	captured by suitable nonlocal corrections.}

	abstract = {The integration of structures supporting Bloch surface waves (BSWs) with optical fibers is highly desirable, since it would enable the development of high-figure-of-merit miniaturized all-fiber optrodes, opening new pathways within the “lab-on-fiber” roadmap. Here, the first experimental demonstration of grating-assisted excitation of BSWs on the tip of single-mode fibers in the near-infrared region is provided. This is attained via fabrication of a 1D diffraction grating on the fiber facet, and subsequent deposition of a 1D photonic crystal. In spite of a resonance broadening due to grating-induced morphological perturbations, the measured Q-factor of 50 is still higher than typical lab-on-tip plasmonic-probe benchmarks. With a view toward biomolecular sensing, a surface sensitivity of 1.22 nm nm−1 of homogeneous overlay deposited over the active region, which is in line with most plasmonic optrodes largely used in connection with optical fibers, is evaluated. The results also highlight the current limitations and the challenges to face for the development of advanced BSW-based fiber-tip platforms for biological sensing applications.}

	abstract={Transformation optics asks, using Maxwell’s equations, what kind of electromagnetic medium recreates some smooth deformation of space? The guiding principle is Einstein’s principle of covariance: that any physical theory must take the same form in any coordinate system. This requirement fixes very precisely the required electromagnetic medium. The impact of this insight cannot be overestimated. Many practitioners were used to thinking that only a few analytic solutions to Maxwell’s equations existed, such as the monochromatic plane wave in a homogeneous, isotropic medium. At a stroke, transformation optics increases that landscape from ‘few’ to ‘infinity’, and to each of the infinitude of analytic solutions dreamt up by the researcher, there corresponds an electromagnetic medium capable of reproducing that solution precisely. The most striking example is the electromagnetic cloak, thought to be an unreachable dream of science fiction writers, but realised in the laboratory a few months after the papers proposing the possibility were published. But the practical challenges are considerable, requiring meta-media that are at once electrically and magnetically inhomogeneous and anisotropic. How far have we come since the first demonstrations over a decade ago? And what does the future hold? If the wizardry of perfect macroscopic optical invisibility still eludes us in practice, then what compromises still enable us to create interesting, useful, devices? While three-dimensional (3D) cloaking remains a significant technical challenge, much progress has been made in two dimensions. Carpet cloaking, wherein an object is hidden under a surface that appears optically flat, relaxes the constraints of extreme electromagnetic parameters. Surface wave cloaking guides sub-wavelength surface waves, making uneven surfaces appear flat. Two dimensions is also the setting in which conformal and complex coordinate transformations are realisable, and the possibilities in this restricted domain do not appear to have been exhausted yet. Beyond cloaking, the enhanced electromagnetic landscape provided by transformation optics has shown how fully analytic solutions can be found to a number of physical scenarios such as plasmonic systems used in electron energy loss spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence. Are there further fields to be enriched? A new twist to transformation optics was the extension to the spacetime domain. By applying transformations to spacetime, rather than just space, it was shown that events rather than objects could be hidden from view; transformation optics had provided a means of effectively redacting events from history. The hype quickly settled into serious nonlinear optical experiments that demonstrated the soundness of the idea, and it is now possible to consider the practical implications, particularly in optical signal processing, of having an ‘interrupt-without-interrupt’ facility that the so-called temporal cloak provides. Inevitable issues of dispersion in actual systems have only begun to be addressed. Now that time is included in the programme of transformation optics, it is natural to ask what role ideas from general relativity can play in shaping the future of transformation optics. Indeed, one of the earliest papers on transformation optics was provocatively titled ‘General Relativity in Electrical Engineering’. The answer that curvature does not enter directly into transformation optics merely encourages us to speculate on the role of transformation optics in defining laboratory analogues. Quite why Maxwell’s theory defines a ‘perfect’ transformation theory, while other areas of physics such as acoustics are not apparently quite so amenable, is a deep question whose precise, mathematical answer will help inform us of the extent to which similar ideas can be extended to other fields. The contributors to this Roadmap, who are all renowned practitioners or inventors of transformation optics, will give their perspectives into the field’s status and future development.}

  abstract={We investigate a class of multilayered metamaterials characterized by moderate-permittivity inclusions and low average permittivity. Via first-principles calculations, we show that in such a scenario, first- and second-order spatial dispersions may exhibit a dramatic and nonresonant enhancement, and may become comparable with the local response. Their interplay gives access to a wealth of dispersion regimes encompassing additional extraordinary waves and topological phase transitions. In particular, we identify a configuration featuring bound and disconnected isofrequency contours. Since they do not rely on high-permittivity inclusions, our proposed metamaterials may constitute an attractive and technologically viable platform for engineering nonlocal effects in the optical range.}

abstract = {Coding metasurfaces, based on the combination of two basic unit cells with out-of-phase responses, have been the subject of many recent studies aimed at achieving diffuse scattering, with potential applications to diverse fields ranging from radar-signature control to computational imaging. Here, via a theoretical study of the relevant scaling-laws, the physical mechanism underlying the scattering-signature reduction is elucidated, and some absolute and realistic bounds are analytically derived. Moreover, a simple, deterministic suboptimal design strategy is introduced that yields results comparable with those typically obtained by approaches based on brute-force numerical optimization, at a negligible fraction of their computational burden, thereby paving the way to the design of structures with arbitrarily large electrical size. Results are corroborated by rigorous full-wave numerical simulations and microwave experiments, and may be of interest in a variety of application fields, such as the design of low-scattering targets and illumination apertures for computational imaging, not necessarily restricted to electromagnetic scenarios.},

  abstract={We demonstrate the existence of exceptional points of degeneracy (EPDs) of periodic eigenstates in non-Hermitian coupled chains of dipolar scatterers. Guided modes supported by these structures can exhibit an EPD in their dispersion diagram at which two or more Bloch eigenstates coalesce, in both their eigenvectors and eigenvalues. We show the emergence of a second-order modal EPD associated with the parity-time (PT) symmetry condition, at which each particle pair in the double chain exhibits balanced gain and loss. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a fourth-order EPD occurring at the band edge. Such a degeneracy condition was previously referred to as a degenerate band edge in lossless anisotropic photonic crystals. Here, we rigorously show it under the occurrence of gain and loss balance for a discrete guiding system. We identify a more general regime of gain and loss balance showing that PT symmetry is not necessary to attain EPDs. Moreover, we investigate the degree of detuning of the EPD when the geometrical symmetry or balanced condition is broken. Furthermore, we demonstrate a realistic implementation of the EPD in a coupled chain made of pairs of plasmonic nanospheres and active core-shell nanospheres at optical frequencies. These findings open avenues toward superior light localization and transport with application to high-Q resonators utilized in sensors, filters, low-threshold switching and lasing.}

For a basic demonstration, we explore some proof-of-principle quasilocal and multilayered implementations and independently validate the outcomes via full-wave numerical simulations.

  abstract={Transformation optics (TO) is conventionally based on real-valued coordinate transformations and, therefore, cannot naturally handle metamaterials featuring gain and/or losses. Motivated by the growing interest in non-Hermitian optical scenarios featuring spatial modulation of gain and loss, and building upon our previous studies, we explore here possible extensions of the TO framework relying on complex-valued coordinate transformations. We show that such extensions can be naturally combined with well-established powerful tools and formalisms in electromagnetics and optics, based on the `complexification' of spatial and spectral quantities. This enables us to deal with rather general non-Hermitian optical scenarios, while retaining the attractive characteristics of conventional (real-valued) TO in terms of physically incisive modeling and geometry-driven intuitive design. As representative examples, we illustrate the manipulation of beam-like wave-objects (modeled in terms of `complex source points') as well as radiating states (leaky waves', modeled in terms of complex-valued propagation constants). Our analytical results, validated against full-wave numerical simulations, provide useful insight into the wave propagation in non-Hermitian scenarios, and may indicate new directions in the synthesis of active optical devices and antennas.}

abstract = {Transformation optics (TO) has established itself as a powerful and versatile approach to the synthesis of metamaterials with prescribed field-manipulation capabilities, via suitable spatial modulation of their constitutive properties inspired by local distortions of the spatial coordinate reference frame. From the mathematical viewpoint, this approach can be reformulated in the frequency-wavenumber reciprocal phase space so as to engineer nonlocal interactions and spatial dispersion effects, which are becoming increasingly relevant in electrodynamics and optics. Here, we present a general nonlocal-TO framework, based on complex-valued, frequency-dependent wavenumber coordinate transformations, and explore its possible applications to scenarios of interest for dispersion engineering. A key attribute of our approach, similar to conventional TO, is the separation of the conceptual design (based on intuitive geometrical considerations) from the actual metamaterial synthesis (based on a suitable approximation of analytically derived constitutive ``blueprints''. To illustrate the capabilities and potential of the proposed approach, we address the engineering (from the conceptual design to the actual synthesis) of multilayered metamaterials exhibiting various exotic dispersion effects, including ``one-way'' (nonreciprocal) propagation, ``frozen-mode'' regime, and Dirac-point conical singularities. Our approach may open up new perspectives in the systematic design of metamaterials with broad field-manipulation capabilities as well as complex spatiotemporal dispersion effects, with potential applications to nonreciprocal optics, topological photonics, and ``computational metamaterials.''},

Our experimental setup is based on a parallel-plate waveguide system, which emulates a two-dimensional plane-wave scattering scenario, and allows the collection of near-field maps as well as more quantitative assessments in terms of global scattering observables (e.g., total scattering width). Our results, in fairly good agreement with full-wave numerical simulations, provide a further illustration of the mantle- cloak mechanism, including its frequency-sensitivity, and confirm its effectiveness both in restoring the near-field impinging wavefront around the scatterer, and in significantly reducing the overall scattering.}

The tunable metamaterial is designed with the aid of two interwoven coordinate-transformation equations and implemented with a network of thin-film resistors and vanadium dioxide (\(VO_2\)). The strong temperature dependence of \(VO_2\) electrical conductivity results in a significant modification of the resistor network behavior, and we provide experimental evidence for a reconfigurable metamaterial electric circuit that not only mimics a continuous medium, but is also capable of responding to thermal stimulation through dynamic variation of its spatial anisotropy. Upon external temperature change, the overall effective functionality of the material switches between a ``truncated cloak'' and a ``concentrator'' for electric currents. Possible applications may include adaptive matching resistor networks, multifunctional electronic devices, and equivalent artificial materials in the magnetic domain. Additionally, the proposed technology could also be relevant for thermal management of integrated circuits.}

abstract={Supersymmetry has been shown to provide a systematic and effective framework for generating classes of isospectral optical structures featuring perfectly-phase-matched modes, with the exception of one (fundamental) mode which can be removed. More recently, this approach has been extended to non-Hermitian scenarios characterized by spatially-modulated distributions of optical loss and gain, in order to allow the removal of higher-order modes as well. In this paper, we apply this approach to the design of non-Hermitian optical couplers with higher-order mode-selection functionalities, with potential applications to mode-division multiplexing in optical links. In particular, we highlight the critical role of the coupling between non-Hermitian optical waveguides, which generally induces a phase transition to a complex eigenspectrum, thereby hindering the targeted mode-selection functionality. With the specific example of an optical coupler that selects the second-order mode of a given waveguide, we illustrate the aforementioned limitations and propose possible strategies to overcome them, bearing in mind the practical feasibility of the gain levels required.},

  abstract={Spatial tailoring of the material constitutive properties is a well-known strategy to mold the local flow of given observables in different physical domains. Coordinate-transformation-based methods (e.g., transformation optics) offer a powerful and systematic approach to design anisotropic, spatially inhomogeneous artificial materials (metamaterials) capable of precisely manipulating wave-based (electromagnetic, acoustic, elastic) as well as diffusion-based (heat) phenomena in a desired fashion. However, as versatile as these approaches have been, most designs have thus far been limited to serving single-target functionalities in a given physical domain. Here, we present a step towards a ``transformation multiphysics'' framework that allows independent and simultaneous manipulation of multiple physical phenomena. As a proof of principle of this new scheme, we design and synthesize (in terms of realistic material constituents) a metamaterial shell that simultaneously behaves as a thermal concentrator and an electrical ``invisibility cloak.'' Our numerical results open up intriguing possibilities in the largely unexplored phase space of multifunctional metadevices, with a wide variety of potential applications to electrical, magnetic, acoustic, and thermal scenarios.}

This tunneling phenomenon is mediated by the excitation of a surface wave localized at the interface separating the loss and gain regions. We determine the parameter configurations for which the phenomenon may occur and, in particular, the relationship between the incidence direction and the electrical thickness. We show that, below a critical threshold of gain and loss, there always exists a tunneling angle which, for moderately thick (wavelength-sized) structures, approaches a critical value dictated by the surface-wave phase-matching condition. We also investigate the unidirectional character of the tunneling phenomenon, as well as the possible onset of spontaneous symmetry breaking, typical of PT-symmetric systems. Our results constitute an interesting example of a PT-symmetry-induced tunneling phenomenon, and may open up intriguing venues in the applications of ENZ materials featuring loss and gain.}

Design/methodology/approach - The approach is based on the transformation optics framework, which allows systematic design and modelling of anisotropic, inhomogeneous metamaterials with inherent field-manipulation capabilities.
Findings - The paper finds that a transformation-optics-based DPS slab can compensate the inherent opaqueness to the electromagnetic radiation of a SNG slab. Here, ``compensation'' means that the resulting bi-layer may give rise to zero-reflection for a normally-incident plane wave at a given frequency. Such phenomenon is inherently accompanied by (de)funneling effects for collimated-beam illumination, and it turns out to be quite robust to material losses as well as geometrical and constitutive-parameter truncation.
Originality/value - The results provide further evidence and insight in how SNG-like responses may be emulated (within narrow parametric ranges) by suitably-engineered spatial inhomogeneity and anisotropy in DPS media. Moreover, they also show that resonant transmission phenomena through SNG materials may be engineered via the powerful framework of transformation optics.}

However, the surface sensitivity (which is a key figure of merit for label-free chemical and biological sensing) needs to be carefully investigated to assess the actual applicability of this technological platform. In this paper, we explore the sensitivity of RAs in metal nanogratings when local refractive-index changes are considered. Our studies reveal that the surface sensitivity deteriorates up to two orders of magnitude by comparison with the corresponding bulk value; interestingly, this residual sensitivity is not attributable to the wavelength shift of the RAs, which are completely insensitive to local refractive-index changes, but rather to a strictly connected plasmonic effect. Our analysis for increasing overlay thickness reveals an ultimate surface sensitivity that approaches the RA bulk value, which turns out to be the upper-limit of grating-assisted surface-plasmon-polariton sensitivities},

From the mathematical viewpoint, these effects can be associated with stationary points of the transfer-matrix trace and can be effectively parametrized via the trace-map formalism. We show that their onset is accompanied by a strong wave-vector dependence in the effective constitutive parameters. Despite the inherent periodicity enforced by the unavoidable (Bloch-type) supercell terminations, we show that such strong nonlocality is retained at any arbitrarily high-order iteration, i.e., approaching the actual aperiodic regime. Moreover, for certain parameter configurations, at a given wavelength and for two given material layers, these effects may be significantly less prominent when the same layers are arranged in a standard periodic fashion. Our findings indicate that the (aperiodic) positional order of the layers constitutes an effective and technologically inexpensive additional degree of freedom in the engineering of optical nonlocality.}

Via experimental measurements and full-wave numerical simulations, these resonant phenomena are characterized with specific reference to the Ammann-Beenker (quasi- periodic, octagonal) tiling lattice geometry and the underlying physics is investigated. In particular, it is shown that, by comparison with standard periodic structures, a moderately richer spectrum of resonant modes may be excited, due to the easier achievement of phase-matching conditions endowed by its denser Bragg spectrum. Such modes are characterized by a distinctive plasmonic or photonic behavior, discriminated by their field distribution and dependence on the metal film thickness. Moreover, the response is accurately predicted via computationally affordable periodic-approximant-based numerical modeling. The enhanced capability of QCs to control number, spectral position, and mode distribution of hybrid resonances may be exploited in a variety of possible applications. To assess this aspect, label-free biosensing is studied via characterization of the surface sensitivity of the proposed structures with respect to local refractive index changes. Moreover, it is also shown that the resonance-engineering capabilities of QC nanostructures may be effectively exploited in order to enhance the absorption efficiency of thin-film solar cells.},

  abstract={We show that the powerful framework of transformation optics may be exploited for engineering the nonlocal response of artificial electromagnetic materials. Relying on the form-invariant properties of coordinate-transformed Maxwell's equations in the spectral domain, we derive the general constitutive ``blueprints'' of transformation media yielding prescribed nonlocal field-manipulation effects and provide a physically incisive and powerful geometrical interpretation in terms of deformation of the equifrequency contours. In order to illustrate the potentials of our approach, we present an example of application to a wave-splitting refraction scenario, which may be implemented via a simple class of artificial materials. Our results provide a systematic and versatile framework which may open intriguing venues in dispersion engineering of artificial materials.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the study of the acousto-optic behavior of underwater-acoustic sensors constituted by fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) coated by ring-shaped overlays. Via full-wave numerical simulations, we study the complex opto-acousto-mechanical interaction among an incident acoustic wave traveling in water, the optical fiber surrounded by the ring shaped coating, and the FBG inscribed the fiber, focusing on the frequency range 0.5-30 kHz of interest for SONAR applications. Our results fully characterize the mechanical behavior of an acoustically driven coated FBG, and highlight the key role played by the coating in enhancing significantly its sensitivity by comparison with a standard uncoated configuration. Furthermore, the hydrophone sensitivity spectrum exhibits characteristic resonances, which strongly improve the sensitivity with respect to its background (i.e., away from resonances) level. Via a three-dimensional modal analysis, we verify that the composite cylindrical structure of the sensor acts as an acoustic resonator tuned at the frequencies of its longitudinal vibration modes. In order to evaluate the sensor performance, we also carry out a comprehensive parametric analysis by varying the geometrical and mechanical properties of the coating, whose results also provide a useful design tool for performance optimization and/or tailoring for specific SONAR applications. Finally, a preliminary validation of the proposed numerical analysis has been carried out through experimental data obtained using polymeric coated FBGs sensors revealing a good agreement and prediction capability.},

With specific reference to the Ammann-Beenker (8-fold symmetric, quasiperiodic) octagonal tiling geometry, we present our experimental results on silicon-on-insulator devices operating at near-infrared wavelengths, and compare them with the full-wave numerical predictions based on periodic approximants. Our results indicate that spatial periodicity is not strictly required for the GR excitation, and may be effectively surrogated by weaker forms of long-range aperiodic order which intrinsically provide extra degrees of freedom (e.g., higher-order rotational symmetries, richer defect states and phase-matching conditions, etc.) to be exploited in the design and performance optimization of nanostructured dielectric slabs operating in the out-of-plane configuration. The essential spectral features may be qualitatively understood in terms of phase-matching conditions derived from approximate homogenized models, and turn out to be effectively captured by full-wave modeling based on suitably-sized periodic approximants.}

In this paper, we extend our previous studies, which were limited to a two-dimensional cylindrical scenario, to the three-dimensional spherical case. More specifically, via a generalized (coordinate-mapped) Mie-series approach, we derive a general analytical full-wave solution pertaining to plane-wave-excited configurations featuring a spherical object surrounded by a TO-based invisibility cloak coupled via a vacuum layer to an anti-cloak, and explore the various interactions of interest. With a number of selected examples, we illustrate the cloaking and field-restoring capabilities of various configurations, highlighting similarities and differences with respect to the cylindrical case, with special emphasis on sensor-cloaking scenarios and ideas for approximate implementations that require the use of double-positive media only.

In this paper, we explore an alternative transformation-optics-based route, which relies on the recently introduced concept of ``anti-cloaking.'' More specifically, our proposed approach relies on a suitable tailoring of the competing cloaking and anti-cloaking mechanisms, interacting in a two-dimensional cylindrical scenario. Via analytical and parametric studies, we illustrate the underlying phenomenology, identify the critical design parameters, and address the relevant optimality and trade-off issues, taking also into account the effect of material losses. Our results confirm the envisaged potentials of the proposed transformation-optics approach as an attractive alternative route to sensor cloaking.},

In particular, with specific reference to square-lattice periodic PCs and aperiodically-ordered Ammann-Beenker photonic quasi-crystals, we study the effects of the hole radius, slab thickness, and refractive index on the GR sensitivity and tunability with respect to variation in the hole refractive index. Finally, we carry out a theoretical and numerical analysis in order to correlate the GR shift with the field distribution of the unperturbed (air holes) structures. Our results indicate that the spatial arrangement of the holes may strongly influence the tuning and sensitivity efficiency, and may provide new degrees of freedom and tools for the design and optimization of novel photonic devices for both sensing and telecommunication applications.},

Abstract = {We present the results of a search for gravitational-wave bursts (GWBs)
   associated with 137 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that were detected by
   satellite-based gamma-ray experiments during the fifth LIGO science run
   and first Virgo science run. The data used in this analysis were
   collected from 2005 November 4 to 2007 October 1, and most of the GRB
   triggers were from the Swift satellite. The search uses a coherent
   network analysis method that takes into account the different locations
   and orientations of the interferometers at the three LIGO-Virgo sites.
   We find no evidence for GWB signals associated with this sample of GRBs.
   Using simulated short-duration (<1 s) waveforms, we set upper limits on
   the amplitude of gravitational waves associated with each GRB. We also
   place lower bounds on the distance to each GRB under the assumption of a
   fixed energy emission in gravitational waves, with a median limit of D
   similar to <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_3xh0zb-1.svg" border="0"/> for emission at
   frequencies around 150 Hz, where the LIGO-Virgo detector network has
   best sensitivity. We present astrophysical interpretations and
   implications of these results, and prospects for corresponding searches
   during future LIGO-Virgo runs.},

	abstract={We present a search for gravitational waves from 116 known millisecond and young pulsars using data from the fifth science run of the LIGO detectors. For this search, ephemerides overlapping the run period were obtained for all pulsars using radio and X-ray observations. We demonstrate an updated search method that allows for small uncertainties in the pulsar phase parameters to be included in the search. We report no signal detection from any of the targets and therefore interpret our results as upper limits on the gravitational wave signal strength. The most interesting limits are those for young pulsars. We present updated limits on gravitational radiation from the Crab pulsar, where the measured limit is now a factor of 7 below the spin-down limit. This limits the power radiated via gravitational waves to be less than 2% of the available spin-down power. For the X-ray pulsar J0537-6910 we reach the spin-down limit under the assumption that any gravitational wave signal from it stays phase locked to the X-ray pulses over timing glitches, and for pulsars J1913+1011 and J1952+3252 we are only a factor of a few above the spin-down limit. Of the recycled millisecond pulsars, several of the measured upper limits are only about an order of magnitude above their spin-down limits. For these our best (lowest) upper limit on gravitational wave amplitude is <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_d7w93z-1.svg" border="0"/> for J1603-7202 and our best (lowest) limit on the inferred pulsar ellipticity is <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_9ffzvm-1.svg" border="0"/> for J2124-3358.}

  abstract={In this paper, we apply transformation-based optics to the derivation of a general class of transparent metamaterial slabs. By means of analytical and numerical full-wave studies, we explore their image-displacement/formation capabilities, and establish intriguing connections with configurations already known in the literature. Starting from these revisitations, we develop a number of nontrivial extensions, and illustrate their possible applications to the design of perfect radomes, anticloaking devices, and focusing devices based on double-positive (possibly nonmagnetic) media. These designs show that such anomalous features may be achieved without necessarily relying on negative-index or strongly resonant metamaterials, suggesting more practical venues for the realization of these devices.}

Abstract = {We present an all-sky search for gravitational waves in the frequency
   range 1 to 6 kHz during the first calendar year of LIGO's fifth science
   run. This is the first untriggered LIGO burst analysis to be conducted
   above 3 kHz. We discuss the unique properties of interferometric data in
   this regime. 161.3 days of triple-coincident data were analyzed. No
   gravitational events above threshold were observed and a frequentist
   upper limit of 5.4 year(-1) on the rate of strong gravitational-wave
   bursts was placed at a 90% confidence level. Implications for specific
   theoretical models of gravitational-wave emission are also discussed.},

Abstract = {{We present the results obtained from an all-sky search for
   gravitational-wave (GW) bursts in the 64-2000 Hz frequency range in data
   collected by the LIGO detectors during the first year (November
   2005-November 2006) of their fifth science run. The total analyzed live
   time was 268.6 days. Multiple hierarchical data analysis methods were
   invoked in this search. The overall sensitivity expressed in terms of
   the root-sum-square (rss) strain amplitude h(rss) for gravitational-wave
   bursts with various morphologies was in the range of <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_30v953-1.svg" border="0"/>
   to a few<img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_qjhqbx-1.svg" border="0"/>. No GW signals were observed and a frequentist
   upper limit of 3.75 events per year on the rate of strong GW bursts was
   placed at the 90% confidence level. As in our previous searches, we
   also combined this rate limit with the detection efficiency for selected
   waveform morphologies to obtain event rate versus strength exclusion
   curves. In sensitivity, these exclusion curves are the most stringent to
   date.}},

  abstract={In a recent investigation, we studied two-dimensional (2D) point-defected photonic bandgap cavities composed of dielectric rods arranged according to various representative periodic and aperiodic lattices, with special emphasis on possible applications to particle acceleration (along the longitudinal axis). In this paper, we present a new study aimed at highlighting the possible advantages of using hybrid structures based on the above dielectric configurations, but featuring metallic rods in the outermost regions, for the design of extremely high quality factor, bandgap-based, accelerating resonators. In this framework, we consider diverse configurations, with different (periodic and aperiodic) lattice geometries, sizes and dielectric/metal fractions. Moreover, we also explore possible improvements attainable via the use of superconducting plates to confine the electromagnetic field in the longitudinal direction. Results from our comparative studies, based on numerical full-wave simulations backed by experimental validations (at room and cryogenic temperatures) in the microwave region, identify the candidate parametric configurations capable of yielding the highest quality factor.}

With specific reference to perforated-slab structures and the Ammann-Beenker octagonal lattice geometry, we carry out full-wave numerical studies of the plane-wave responses and of the underlying modal structures, which illustrate the representative effects induced by the introduction of symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking defects. Our results demonstrate that breaking the supercell mirror symmetries via the judicious introduction of point-defects enables for the excitation of otherwise uncoupled GRs, with control on the symmetry properties of their field distributions, thereby constituting an attractive alternative to those GR-engineering approaches based on the asymmetrization of the hole shape. In this framework, aperiodically-ordered supercells seem to be inherently suited, in view of the variety of inequivalent defect sites that they can offer.},

  abstract={Coordinate-transformation approaches to invisibility cloaking rely on the design of an anisotropic, spatially inhomogeneous ``transformation medium'' capable of suitably rerouting the energy flux around the region to conceal without causing any scattering in the exterior region. It is well known that the inherently magnetic properties of such medium limit the high-frequency scaling of practical ``metamaterial'' implementations based on subwavelength inclusions (e.g., split-ring resonators). Thus, for the optical range, nonmagnetic implementations, based on approximate reductions of the constitutive parameters, have been proposed. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to nonmagnetic coordinate-transformation cloaking, based on the mapping from a nearly transparent, anisotropic and spatially inhomogeneous virtual domain. We show that, unlike its counterparts in the literature, our approach is amenable to exact analytic treatment, and that its overall performance is comparable to that of a nonideal (lossy, dispersive, parameter truncated) implementation of standard (magnetic) cloaking.}

Title = {Search for gravitational wave ringdowns from perturbed black holes in

Abstract = {According to general relativity a perturbed black hole will settle to a
   stationary configuration by the emission of gravitational radiation.
   Such a perturbation will occur, for example, in the coalescence of a
   black hole binary, following their inspiral and subsequent merger. At
   late times the waveform is a superposition of quasinormal modes, which
   we refer to as the ringdown. The dominant mode is expected to be the
   fundamental mode, \(l = m = 2\). Since this is a well-known waveform,
   matched filtering can be implemented to search for this signal using
   LIGO data. We present a search for gravitational waves from black hole
   ringdowns in the fourth LIGO science run S4, during which LIGO was
   sensitive to the dominant mode of perturbed black holes with masses in
   the range of \(10M_\odot\) to \(500M_\odot\), the regime of
   intermediate-mass black holes, to distances up to 300 Mpc. We present a
   search for gravitational waves from black hole ringdowns using data from
   S4. No gravitational wave candidates were found; we place a
   90\%-confidence upper limit on the rate of ringdowns from black holes
   with mass between \(85 M_\odot\) and \(390M_\odot\) in the local
   universe, assuming a uniform distribution of sources, of <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_kgz5po-1.svg" border="0"/>, where <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_hc6nkt-1.svg" border="0"/> is <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_8nznbr-1.svg" border="0"/>

Abstract = {{A stochastic background of gravitational waves is expected to arise from
   a superposition of a large number of unresolved gravitational-wave
   sources of astrophysical and cosmological origin. It should carry unique
   signatures from the earliest epochs in the evolution of the Universe,
   inaccessible to standard astrophysical observations(1). Direct
   measurements of the amplitude of this background are therefore of
   fundamental importance for understanding the evolution of the Universe
   when it was younger than one minute. Here we report limits on the
   amplitude of the stochastic gravitational-wave background using the data
   from a two-year science run of the Laser Interferometer
   Gravitational-wave Observatory(2) (LIGO). Our result constrains the
   energy density of the stochastic gravitational-wave background
   normalized by the critical energy density of the Universe, in the
   frequency band around 100 Hz, to be <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_s2er4i-1.svg" border="0"/> at 95\% confidence.
   The data rule out models of early Universe evolution with relatively
   large equation-of-state parameter(3), as well as cosmic (super) string
   models with relatively small string tension(4) that are favoured in some
   string theory models(5). This search for the stochastic background
   improves on the indirect limits from Big Bang nucleosynthesis(1,6) and
   cosmic microwave background(7) at 100Hz.}},

Abstract = {We report on a search for gravitational waves from coalescing compact
   binaries, of total mass between 2 and \(35M_\odot\), using LIGO
   observations between November 14, 2006 and May 18, 2007. No
   gravitational-wave signals were detected. We report upper limits on the
   rate of compact binary coalescence as a function of total mass. The LIGO
   cumulative 90%-confidence rate upper limits of the binary coalescence
   of neutron stars, black holes and black hole-neutron star systems are

Abstract = {This paper reports on an all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves
   from sources such as deformed isolated rapidly spinning neutron stars.
   The analysis uses 840 hours of data from 66 days of the fifth LIGO
   science run (S5). The data were searched for quasimonochromatic waves
   with frequencies \(f\) in the range from 50 to 1500 Hz, with a linear
   frequency drift \(\dot f\) center dot (measured at the solar system barycenter)
   in the range \(-f/\tau < \dot f < 0.1 f/\tau\), for a minimum spin-down
   age tau of 1000 years for signals below 400 Hz and 8000 years above 400
   Hz. The main computational work of the search was distributed over
   approximately 100 000 computers volunteered by the general public. This
   large computing power allowed the use of a relatively long coherent
   integration time of 30 hours while searching a large parameter space.
   This search extends Einstein@Home's previous search in LIGO S4 data to
   about 3 times better sensitivity. No statistically significant signals
   were found. In the 125-225 Hz band, more than 90% of sources with
   dimensionless gravitational-wave strain tensor amplitude greater than

Abstract = {We present the results of a LIGO search for short-duration gravitational
   waves (GWs) associated with the 2006 March 29 SGR 1900+14 storm. A new
   search method is used, ``stacking{''} the GW data around the times of
   individual soft-gamma bursts in the storm to enhance sensitivity for
   models in which multiple bursts are accompanied by GW emission. We
   assume that variation in the time difference between burst
   electromagnetic emission and potential burst GW emission is small
   relative to the GW signal duration, and we time-align GW excess power
   time-frequency tilings containing individual burst triggers to their
   corresponding electromagnetic emissions. We use two GW emission models
   in our search: a fluence-weighted model and a flat (unweighted) model
   for the most electromagnetically energetic bursts. We find no evidence
   of GWs associated with either model. Model-dependent GW strain,
   isotropic GW emission energy

<img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_5pf4c4-1.svg" border="0"/> 
upper limits
   are estimated using a variety of assumed waveforms. The stacking method
   allows us to set the most stringent model-dependent limits on transient
   GW strain published to date. We find E(GW) upper limit estimates (at a
   nominal distance of 10 kpc) of between 
   <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_ef2rgu-1.svg" border="0"/>
    erg and 
   <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_9okn3e-1.svg" border="0"/>
    erg
   depending on the waveform type. These limits are an order of magnitude
   lower than upper limits published previously for this storm and overlap
   with the range of electromagnetic energies emitted in soft gamma
   repeater (SGR) giant flares.},

Abstract = {The goal of the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory
   (LIGO) is to detect and study gravitational waves (GWs) of astrophysical
   origin. Direct detection of GWs holds the promise of testing general
   relativity in the strong-field regime, of providing a new probe of
   exotic objects such as black holes and neutron stars and of uncovering
   unanticipated new astrophysics. LIGO, a joint Caltech-MIT project
   supported by the National Science Foundation, operates three
   multi-kilometer interferometers at two widely separated sites in the
   United States. These detectors are the result of decades of worldwide
   technology development, design, construction and commissioning. They are
   now operating at their design sensitivity, and are sensitive to
   gravitational wave strains smaller than one part in
      <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_10e3j0-1.svg" border="0"/>. With this
   unprecedented sensitivity, the data are being analyzed to detect or
   place limits on GWs from a variety of potential astrophysical sources.},

Abstract = {We have searched for gravitational waves from coalescing low mass
   compact binary systems with a total mass between \(2M_\odot\) and
   \(35M_\odot\) and a minimum component mass of 1M(circle dot) using
   data from the first year of the fifth science run of the three LIGO
   detectors, operating at design sensitivity. Depending on the mass, we
   are sensitive to coalescences as far as 150 Mpc from the Earth. No
   gravitational-wave signals were observed above the expected background.
   Assuming a population of compact binary objects with a Gaussian mass
   distribution representing binary neutron star systems, black
   hole-neutron star binary systems, and binary black hole systems, we
   calculate the 90% confidence upper limit on the rate of coalescences to
   be

   We also set improved upper limits on the rate of
   compact binary coalescences per unit blue-light luminosity, as a

Via a full-wave numerical study of the transmittance response and the modal structure of a photonic quasicrystal (PQC) slab based on a representative aperiodic geometry (Ammann-Beenker octagonal tiling), we demonstrate the possibility of exciting GR modes, and highlight similarities and differences with the periodic case. In particular, we show that, as for the periodic case, GRs arise from the coupling of the incident plane-wave with degenerate modes of the PQC slab that exhibit a matching symmetry in the spatial distribution, and can still be parameterized via a Fano-like model. Besides the phenomenological implications, our results may provide new degrees of freedom in the engineering of GRs, and pave the way for new developments and applications.},

abstract = {Coordinate-transformation cloaking is based on the design of a metamaterial shell made of an anisotropic, spatially inhomogeneous ``transformation medium'' that allows rerouting the impinging wave around a given region of space. In its original version, it is generally believed that, in the ideal limit, the radiation cannot penetrate the cloaking shell (from outside to inside, and viceversa). However, it was recently shown by Chen et al. that electromagnetic fields may actually penetrate the cloaked region, provided that this region contains double-negative transformation media which, via proper design, may be in principle used to (partially or totally) ``undo'' the cloaking transformation, thereby acting as an ``anti-cloak.'' In this paper, we further elaborate this concept, by considering a more general scenario of cloak/anti-cloak interactions. Our full-wave analytical study provides new insightful results and explores the effects of departure from ideality, suggesting also some novel scenarios for potential applications.},

We also show that leaky waves are supported by a PQC slab and that the beamwidth is directly proportional to the leaky wave attenuation constant, which provides a physically incisive interpretation of the observed radiation characteristics.}

The arising nonlinearly-constrained optimization problem is recast, via the Lagrange method, in the unconstrained optimization of a non-quadratic cost function, for which an iterative technique is proposed. The implementation via artificial neural networks is addressed, and results are compared with those obtained via standard schemes.}

Specifically, for representative geometries, we study the properties of the fundamental mode (as a function of the filling fraction, structure size, and losses) via two-dimensional and three-dimensional full-wave numerical simulations, as well as microwave measurements at room temperature. Results indicate that for reduced-size structures, aperiodic geometries exhibit superior confinement properties by comparison with periodic ones.},

Abstract = {We report on the methods and results of the first dedicated search for
   gravitational waves emitted during the inspiral of compact binaries with
   spinning component bodies. We analyze 788 hours of data collected during
   the third science run (S3) of the LIGO detectors. We searched for binary
   systems using a detection template family specially designed to capture
   the effects of the spin-induced precession of the orbital plane. We
   present details of the techniques developed to enable this search for
   spin-modulated gravitational waves, highlighting the differences between
   this and other recent searches for binaries with nonspinning components.
   The template bank we employed was found to yield high matches with our
   spin-modulated target waveform for binaries with masses in the
   asymmetric range \(1.0 M_\odot < m_1 < 3.0M_\odot\) and
   \(12.0M_\odot < m_2 < 20.0M_\odot\) which is where we would
   expect the spin of the binary's components to have a significant effect.
   We find that our search of S3 LIGO data has good sensitivity to binaries
   in the Milky Way and to a small fraction of binaries in M31 and M33 with
   masses in the range \(1.0 M_\odot < m_1\), \(m_2 < 20.0 M_\odot\).
   No gravitational wave signals were identified during this search.
   Assuming a binary population with spinning components and Gaussian
   distribution of masses representing a prototypical neutron star-black
   hole system with \(m_1\) similar or equal to \(1.35M_\odot\) and \(m_2\)
   similar or equal to \(5M_\odot\), we calculate the 90%-confidence
   upper limit on the rate of coalescence of these systems to be

For this configuration, we carry out a comprehensive parametric study of the ray-dynamical and full-wave scattering (monostatic and bistatic radar-cross-section) signatures, with emphasis on possible implications for high-frequency wave asymptotics (``ray-chaotic footprints'').},

Abstract = {We analyzed the available LIGO data coincident with GRB 070201, a
   short-duration, hard-spectrum gamma-ray burst (GRB) whose
   electromagnetically determined sky position is coincident with the
   spiral arms of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). Possible progenitors of such
   short, hard GRBs include mergers of neutron stars or a neutron star and
   a black hole, or soft gamma-ray repeater (SGR) flares. These events can
   be accompanied by gravitational-wave emission. No plausible
   gravitational-wave candidates were found within a 180 s long window
   around the time of GRB 070201. This result implies that a compact binary
   progenitor of GRB 070201, with masses in the range \(1 M_\odot < m_1
   < 3 M_\odot\) and \(1 M_\odot< m_2 < 40 M_\odot\), located in
   M31 is excluded at > 99% confidence. If the GRB 070201 progenitor was
   not in M31, then we can exclude a binary neutron star merger progenitor

  abstract={We present the key results from a comprehensive study of the refraction and focusing properties of a two-dimensional dodecagonal photonic ``quasicrystal'' (PQC), which was carried out via both full-wave numerical simulations and microwave measurements on a slab made of alumina rods inserted in a parallel-plate waveguide. We observe an anomalous refraction and focusing in several frequency regions, which confirm some recently published results. However, our interpretation, which is based on numerical and experimental evidence, substantially differs from the one in terms of ``effective negative refractive index'' that was originally proposed. Instead, our study highlights the critical role played by short-range interactions associated with local order and symmetry.}

Abstract = {The first simultaneous operation of the AURIGA detector(63) and the LIGO
   observatory(64) was an opportunity to explore real data, joint analysis
   methods between two very different types of gravitational wave
   detectors: resonant bars and interferometers. This paper describes a
   coincident gravitational wave burst search, where data from the LIGO
   interferometers are cross-correlated at the time of AURIGA candidate
   events to identify coincident transients. The analysis pipeline is tuned
   with two thresholds, on the signal-to-noise ratio of AURIGA candidate
   events and on the significance of the cross-correlation test in LIGO.
   The false alarm rate is estimated by introducing time shifts between
   data sets and the network detection efficiency is measured by adding
   simulated gravitational wave signals to the detector output. The
   simulated waveforms have a significant fraction of power in the narrower
   AURIGA band. In the absence of a detection, we discuss how to set an
   upper limit on the rate of gravitational waves and to interpret it
   according to different source models. Due to the short amount of
   analyzed data and to the high rate of non-Gaussian transients in the
   detectors' noise at the time, the relevance of this study is
   methodological: this was the first joint search for gravitational wave
   bursts among detectors with such different spectral sensitivity and the
   first opportunity for the resonant and interferometric communities to
   unify languages and techniques in the pursuit of their common goal.},

Our full-wave numerical analysis confirms the results recently emerged in the technical literature and, in particular, the possibility of achieving focusing effects within several frequency regions. However, contrary to the original interpretation, such focusing effects turn out to be critically associated to local symmetry points in the PQC slab, and strongly dependent on its thickness and termination. Nevertheless, our study reveals the presence of some peculiar properties, like the ability to focus the light even for slabs with a reduced lateral width, or beaming effects, which render PQC slabs potentially interesting and worth of deeper investigation.

Abstract = {We present the results of a search for short-duration gravitational-wave
   bursts associated with 39 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by gamma-ray
   satellite experiments during LIGO's S2, S3, and S4 science runs. The
   search involves calculating the crosscorrelation between two
   interferometer data streams surrounding the GRB trigger time. We search
   for associated gravitational radiation from single GRBs, and also apply
   statistical tests to search for a gravitational-wave signature
   associated with the whole sample. For the sample examined, we find no
   evidence for the association of gravitational radiation with GRBs,
   either on a single-GRB basis or on a statistical basis. Simulating
   gravitational-wave bursts with sine-Gaussian waveforms, we set upper
   limits on the root-sum-square of the gravitational-wave strain amplitude
   of such waveforms at the times of the GRB triggers. We also demonstrate
   how a sample of several GRBs can be used collectively to set constraints
   on population models. The small number of GRBs and the significant
   change in sensitivity of the detectors over the three runs, however,
   limits the usefulness of a population study for the S2, S3, and S4 runs.
   Finally, we discuss prospects for the search sensitivity for the ongoing
   S5 run, and beyond for the next generation of detectors.},

Abstract = {We report on a search for gravitational waves from the coalescence of
   compact binaries during the third and fourth LIGO science runs. The
   search focused on gravitational waves generated during the inspiral
   phase of the binary evolution. In our analysis, we considered three
   categories of compact binary systems, ordered by mass: (i) primordial
   black hole binaries with masses in the range \(0.35M_\odot < m_1, m_2 <
   1.0M_\odot\), (ii) binary neutron stars with masses in the range \(1.0M_\odot
  < m_1, m_2 < 3.0M_\odot\), and (iii) binary black holes with
   masses in the range

   was set to \(40.0M_\odot\)
   and \(80.0M_\odot\) in the third and fourth science runs,
   respectively. Although the detectors could probe to distances as far as
   tens of Mpc, no gravitational-wave signals were identified in the 1364
   hours of data we analyzed. Assuming a binary population with a Gaussian
   distribution around \(0.75 - 0.75M_\odot\), 
   \(1.4 - 1.4M_\odot\), and   \(5.0 - 5.0M_\odot\), we derived 90%- confidence upper limit rates of

   to zero.
   Data from the fourth LIGO science run (S4) have been used in this
   search. Three different semicoherent methods of transforming and summing
   strain power from short Fourier transforms (SFTs) of the calibrated data
   have been used. The first, known as StackSlide, averages normalized
   power from each SFT. A ``weighted Hough{''} scheme is also developed and
   used, which also allows for a multi-interferometer search. The third
   method, known as PowerFlux, is a variant of the StackSlide method in
   which the power is weighted before summing. In both the weighted Hough
   and PowerFlux methods, the weights are chosen according to the noise and
   detector antenna-pattern to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. The
   respective advantages and disadvantages of these methods are discussed.
   Observing no evidence of periodic gravitational radiation, we report
   upper limits; we interpret these as limits on this radiation from
   isolated rotating neutron stars. The best population-based upper limit
   with 95% confidence on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude, found
   for simulated sources distributed isotropically across the sky and with
   isotropically distributed spin axes, is 
<img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_zyes61-1.svg" border="0"/>
   (near 140 Hz).
   Strict upper limits are also obtained for small patches on the sky for
   best-case and worst-case inclinations of the spin axes.},

  abstract={Suitable shaping (in particular, flattening and broadening) of the laser beam has recently been proposed as an effective device to reduce internal (mirror) thermal noise in advanced gravitational-wave interferometric detectors. Based on some recently published analytic approximations (valid in the infinite-test-mass limit) for the Brownian and thermoelastic mirror noises in the presence of arbitrary-shaped beams, this paper addresses certain preliminary issues related to the optimal beam-shaping problem. In particular, with specific reference to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) experiment, absolute and realistic lower bounds for the various thermal-noise constituents are obtained and compared with the current status (Gaussian beams) and trends (mesa beams), indicating fairly ample margins for further reduction. In this framework, the effective dimension of the related optimization problem, and its relationship to the critical design parameters are identified, physical-feasibility and model-consistency issues are considered, and possible additional requirements and/or prior information exploitable to drive the subsequent optimization process are highlighted.}

Abstract = {The fourth science run of the LIGO and GEO 600 gravitational-wave
   detectors, carried out in early 2005, collected data with significantly
   lower noise than previous science runs. We report on a search for
   short-duration gravitational-wave bursts with arbitrary waveform in the
   64-1600 Hz frequency range appearing in all three LIGO interferometers.
   Signal consistency tests, data quality cuts and auxiliary-channel vetoes
   are applied to reduce the rate of spurious triggers. No
   gravitational-wave signals are detected in 15.5 days of live observation
   time; we set a frequentist upper limit of 
 <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_2djlsy-1.svg" border="0"/>
    ( at 90\%
   confidence level) on the rate of bursts with large enough amplitudes to
   be detected reliably. The amplitude sensitivity of the search,
   characterized using Monte Carlo simulations, is several times better
   than that of previous searches. We also provide rough estimates of the
   distances at which representative supernova and binary black hole merger
   signals could be detected with 50\% efficiency by this analysis.},

Title = {Upper limit map of a background of gravitational waves},

Abstract = {We searched for an anisotropic background of gravitational waves using
   data from the LIGO S4 science run and a method that is optimized for
   point sources. This is appropriate if, for example, the gravitational
   wave background is dominated by a small number of distinct astrophysical
   sources. No signal was seen. Upper limit maps were produced assuming two
   different power laws for the source strain power spectrum. For an   
   <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_6debcv-1.svg" border="0"/>
   power law and using the 50 Hz to 1.8 kHz band the upper limits on the
   source strain power spectrum vary between 
   <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_96918m-1.svg" border="0"/> 
   and 
   <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_h4wnkj-1.svg" border="0"/>, 
   depending on the
   position in the sky. Similarly, in the case of constant strain power
   spectrum, the upper limits vary between 
   <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_wr4cxy-1.svg" border="0"/>
    and 
   <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_hi1i31-1.svg" border="0"/>. 
   As a side product a limit on an isotropic background of
   gravitational waves was also obtained. All limits are at the 90%
   confidence level. Finally, as an application, we focused on the
   direction of Sco-X1, the brightest low-mass x-ray binary. We compare the
   upper limit on strain amplitude obtained by this method to expectations
   based on the x-ray flux from Sco-X1.},

Title = {Searches for periodic gravitational waves from unknown isolated sources
   and Scorpius X-1: Results from the second LIGO science run},
Journal = {Physical Review D},
Year = {2007},

Abstract = {We carry out two searches for periodic gravitational waves using the
   most sensitive few hours of data from the second LIGO science run. Both
   searches exploit fully coherent matched filtering and cover wide areas
   of parameter space, an innovation over previous analyses which requires
   considerable algorithm development and computational power. The first
   search is targeted at isolated, previously unknown neutron stars, covers
   the entire sky in the frequency band 160-728.8 Hz, and assumes a
   frequency derivative of less than 
     <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_vyf1zn-1.svg" border="0"/>. The second search
   targets the accreting neutron star in the low-mass x-ray binary Scorpius
   X-1 and covers the frequency bands 464-484 Hz and 604-624 Hz as well as
   the two relevant binary orbit parameters. Because of the high
   computational cost of these searches we limit the analyses to the most
   sensitive 10 hours and 6 hours of data, respectively. Given the limited
   sensitivity and duration of the analyzed data set, we do not attempt
   deep follow-up studies. Rather we concentrate on demonstrating the data
   analysis method on a real data set and present our results as upper
   limits over large volumes of the parameter space. In order to achieve
   this, we look for coincidences in parameter space between the Livingston
   and Hanford 4-km interferometers. For isolated neutron stars our 95\%
   confidence level upper limits on the gravitational wave strain amplitude
   range from 
  <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_a8knb2-1.svg" border="0"/>       
   to 
     <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_dopsgn-1.svg" border="0"/> 
   across the frequency band; for
   Scorpius X-1 they range from 
  <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_dgfh4g-1.svg" border="0"/>    
   to 
  <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_j0qznl-1.svg" border="0"/>   
    across the
   two 20-Hz frequency bands. The upper limits presented in this paper are
   the first broadband wide parameter space upper limits on periodic
   gravitational waves from coherent search techniques. The methods
   developed here lay the foundations for upcoming hierarchical searches of
   more sensitive data which may detect astrophysical signals.},

Title = {Search for gravitational wave radiation associated with the pulsating

Abstract = {We have searched for gravitational waves (GWs) associated with the SGR
   1806-20 hyperflare of 27 December 2004. This event, originating from a
   Galactic neutron star, displayed exceptional energetics. Recent
   investigations of the x-ray light curve's pulsating tail revealed the
   presence of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in the 30-2000 Hz
   frequency range, most of which coincides with the bandwidth of the LIGO
   detectors. These QPOs, with well-characterized frequencies, can
   plausibly be attributed to seismic modes of the neutron star which could
   emit GWs. Our search targeted potential quasimonochromatic GWs lasting
   for tens of seconds and emitted at the QPO frequencies. We have observed
   no candidate signals above a predetermined threshold, and our lowest
   upper limit was set by the 92.5 Hz QPO observed in the interval from 150
   s to 260 s after the start of the flare. This bound corresponds to a
   (90% confidence) root-sum-squared amplitude
<img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_za8m8c-1.svg" border="0"/>     
   on the GW waveform strength
   in the detectable polarization state reaching our Hanford (WA) 4 km
   detector. We illustrate the astrophysical significance of the result via
   an estimated characteristic energy in GW emission that we would expect
   to be able to detect. The above result corresponds to 
<img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_1erdbj-1.svg" border="0"/>, which is of the same order as the total (isotropic)
   energy emitted in the electromagnetic spectrum. This result provides a
   means to probe the energy reservoir of the source with the best upper
   limit on the GW waveform strength published and represents the first
   broadband asteroseismology measurement using a GW detector.},

abstract = { We present a simple prototype study of electromagnetic radiation by a one-dimensional quasiperiodic Fibonacci-type array laid on a grounded dielectric slab, extending our previous free-space studies. Analytic parameterization of the interaction between aperiodic-order-induced "quasi-Floquet" waves and slab-induced surface/leaky-waves is addressed, for infinite and truncated arrays, via generalized Poisson summation and uniform asymptotics. Accuracy and computational effectiveness of the proposed parameterizations are assessed via numerical comparisons against an independently-generated reference solution (element-by-element synthesis). }

Abstract = {We present upper limits on the gravitational wave emission from 78 radio
   pulsars based on data from the third and fourth science runs of the LIGO
   and GEO 600 gravitational wave detectors. The data from both runs have
   been combined coherently to maximize sensitivity. For the first time,
   pulsars within binary (or multiple) systems have been included in the
   search by taking into account the signal modulation due to their orbits.
   Our upper limits are therefore the first measured for 56 of these
   pulsars. For the remaining 22, our results improve on previous upper
   limits by up to a factor of 10. For example, our tightest upper limit on
   the gravitational strain is 
<img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_up4shb-1.svg" border="0"/>    
   for PSR J1603-7202, and the
   equatorial ellipticity of PSR J2124-3358 is less than 
<img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_mtk7nx-1.svg" border="0"/>.
   Furthermore, our strain upper limit for the Crab pulsar is only 2.2
   times greater than the fiducial spin-down limit.},

Abstract = {Data from the LIGO Livingston interferometer and the ALLEGRO
   resonant-bar detector, taken during LIGO's fourth science run, were
   examined for cross correlations indicative of a stochastic
   gravitational-wave background in the frequency range 850-950 Hz, with
   most of the sensitivity arising between 905 and 925 Hz. ALLEGRO was
   operated in three different orientations during the experiment to
   modulate the relative sign of gravitational-wave and environmental
   correlations. No statistically significant correlations were seen in any
   of the orientations, and the results were used to set a Bayesian 90\%
   confidence level upper limit of 
 <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_apu0ua-1.svg" border="0"/>,
    which corresponds
   to a gravitational-wave strain at 915 Hz of 
   <img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_kcvtgc-1.svg" border="0"/>. 
   In the
   traditional units of 
<img style='vertical-align:middle;' src="/assets/images/equations/imgtemp_hpsi0s-1.svg" border="0"/>, this is a limit of 0.53, 2
   orders of magnitude better than the previous direct limit at these
   frequencies. The method was also validated with successful extraction of
   simulated signals injected in hardware and software.},

Within this context, motivated by the fairly recent discovery in X-ray crystallography of ``quasi-crystals'', whose diffraction patterns display unusual characteristics that are associated with ``aperiodic order'', we have undertaken a systematic study of how these exotic effects manifest themselves in the radiation properties of aperiodically configured antenna arrays. The background for these studies, with promising example configurations, has been reported in a previous publication [V. Pierro et al., IEEE Trans. Antennas Propag., vol. 53, pp. 635-644, Feb. 2005]. In this paper, we pay attention to various configurations generated by Rudin-Shapiro (RS) sequences, which constitute one of the simplest conceivable examples of deterministic aperiodic geometries featuring random-like (dis)order. After presentation and review of relevant background material, the radiation properties of one-dimensional RS-based antenna arrays are analyzed, followed by illustrative numerical parametric studies to validate the theoretical models. Design parameters and potential practical applications are also given attention.},

abstract={The fairly recent discovery of ``quasi-crystals'', whose X-ray diffraction patterns reveal certain peculiar features which do not conform with spatial periodicity, has motivated studies of the wave-dynamical implications of "aperiodic order". Within the context of the radiation properties of antenna arrays, an instructive novel (canonical) example of wave interactions with quasi-periodic order is illustrated here for one-dimensional array configurations based on the ``modified-Fibonacci'' sequence, with utilization of a two-scale generalization of the standard Poisson summation formula for periodic arrays. This allows for a ``quasi-Floquet'' analytic parameterization of the radiated field, which provides instructive insights into some of the basic wave mechanisms associated with quasi-periodic order, highlighting similarities and differences with the periodic case. Examples are shown for quasi-periodic infinite and spatially-truncated arrays, with brief discussion of computational issues and potential applications.},

Among the band gaps, some exhibit a behavior similar to that typical of photonic crystals, while others do not. The development of certain band gaps requires large-size quasicrystals. It is explained by the long-range interactions involved in their formation. Moreover, the frequencies where the band gaps occur are not necessarily explained using single scattering and should therefore involve multiple scattering.}

Though strictly nonchaotic, it is demonstrated that under appropriate conditions which are inferred from a comprehensive parametric database generated via the above-noted rigorous reference solution, the high-frequency wave dynamics exhibits trends toward irregularity and other peculiar characteristics; these features can be interpreted as ``ray-chaotic footprints'', and they are usually not observed in geometries characterized by ``regular'' ray behavior.

abstract={In this paper, we use higher order impedance boundary conditions (HOIBCs) for studying high frequency asymptotic two-dimensional (2-D) scattering of truncated aperture-generated electromagnetic fields from planar conducting surfaces coated by multiple layers of homogeneous bi-anisotropic media. The reflected field syntheses are carried out via asymptotic reduction of rigorous plane-wave spectral integrals, which are subsequently discretized and transformed to the spatial domain through use of a Gabor-based narrow-waisted (NW) Gaussian beam (GB) algorithm. In this discretized algorithm, the GB propagators are approximated by previously explored standard and modified (uniform) complex-source-point paraxial asymptotic techniques. Example applications are restricted to zeroth and second order IBCs for single- and multilayer complex coatings, with emphasis on the adaptation of the NW-GBs to the HOIBC launch conditions in the presence of localizing (e.g., focused and/or abruptly truncated) illumination. The results confirm that the previously established utility of the NW-GB algorithm with respect to accuracy and computational feasibility continues to hold for this fairly general combination of environmental complexity and strongly inhomogeneous (localizing) illumination.},

The proposed approach works with sparse data and relies on recently developed Gabor-based narrow-waisted quasi-ray Gaussian beam algorithms as fast forward scattering predictive models. First, a nonlinear inverse scattering problem is solved to estimate the unknown coarse-scale roughness profile. This sets the stage for adaptive compensation of clutter-induced distortion in the underground imaging problem, which is linearized via Born approximation and subsequently solved via various pixel-based and object-based techniques. Numerical simulations are presented to assess accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency for various calibrated ranges of problem parameters. The proposed approach has potential applications to antipersonnel land mine remediation.},

abstract={A previously developed Gabor-based quasi-ray narrow-waisted (NW) Gaussian beam (GB) algorithm for time-harmonic propagation of aperture-excited two-dimensional (2-D) electromagnetic fields through a planar dielectric layer is extended here to the time domain (TD) to deal with short-pulse excitation. The dielectric layer is assumed to be nondispersive; however, slight Ohmic losses can be accommodated. The frequency domain (FD) algorithm is based on a self-consistent discretization of the aperture field distribution in terms of basis NW-GBs in conjunction with an efficient quasireal ray tracing scheme for tracking the individual basis beams. The TD results are obtained by analytic Fourier inversion from the FD in terms of pulsed beam wavepackets, following a procedure similar to that utilized by Galdi et al. (see IEEE Trans. Antennas Propagat., vol.49, p.1322-32, Sept. 2001) in connection with free-space aperture radiation.

Restricting attention here primarily to two-dimensional (2-D) fields and physical configurations, applications include phased and focused truncated plane-aperture-generated illumination of layered dielectrics, moderately rough air-soil interfaces, and buried objects in rough-surface-bounded halfspaces in forward scattering scenarios, as well as rough interface profile reconstruction and buried-target imaging from sparse data in inverse scattering scenarios.

This study extends to the SP-TD in our previous investigation of time-harmonic high frequency 2-D scattering of Gabor-based quasi-ray Gaussian beam fields excited by 1-D aperture field distributions in the presence of moderately rough dielectric interfaces (Galdi et al.). The proposed approach is based on the Kirchhoff physical optics (PO) approximation in conjunction with the Gabor-based quasi-ray narrow-waisted Gaussian pulsed-beam (PB) discretization (Galdi et al.), which is applied to the SP-induced equivalent magnetic surface currents on the interface that establish the TD reflected/transmitted fields. We show that, for well-collimated truncated SP incident fields, the PO-PB synthesis of the reflected/transmitted fields yields an approximate explicit physically appealing, numerically efficient asymptotic algorithm, with well-defined domains of validity based on the problem parameters. An extensive series of numerical experiments verifies the accuracy of our method by comparison with a rigorously-based numerical reference solution, and assesses its computational utility. The algorithm is intended for use as a rapid forward solver in SP-TD inverse scattering and imaging scenarios in the presence of moderately rough dielectric interfaces.},

abstract={This paper deals with the short-pulse radiation of three-dimensional (3-D) vector electromagnetic fields from arbitrarily polarized large two-dimensional (2-D) truncated aperture distributions, which are parameterized in terms of narrow-waisted ray-like pulsed Gaussian basis beams centered on a discretized Gabor lattice in a four-dimensional (4-D) configuration-spectrum phase space. The study extends our previous Gabor-based investigation of time-domain (TD) short-pulse radiation of 2-D fields from 1-D large truncated apertures with nonphased, linearly phased (delayed) and nonlinearly phased focusing aperture field profiles . We begin with, and summarize, a Gabor-based frequency domain (FD) formulation of the 2-D aperture problem which has been presented and tested elsewhere, but we include additional numerical examples for validation and quality assessment. As done by Galdi, Felsen and Casta\~non (see ibid., vol 49, p. 1322-32, Sept. 2001) we access the time domain by Fourier inversion from the FD, starting from the initial 3-D space-time Kirchhoff formulation (whose numerical integration furnishes reference solutions), and then passing on to Gabor-parameterized field representations in terms of pulsed beam (PB) wavepackets which are launched by linearly and nonlinearly phase-delayed focusing aperture distributions. Example calculations and comparisons with numerically generated reference data serve to calibrate the Gabor-PB algorithms and assess their domains of validity.},

abstract = {An adaptive framework is presented for frequency-stepped ground-penetrating radar (GPR) imaging of low-contrast buried objects in the presence of a moderately rough air?soil interface, with potential applications intended in the area of humanitarian demining. The proposed approach, so far restricted to two-dimeansional (2-D) geometries, works with sparse data and relies on recently developed problem-matched narrow-waisted Gaussian beam (GB) algorithms as fast forward scattering predictive models to estimate and compensate for the effects of the coarse-scale roughness profile. Possible targets are subsequently imaged by inverting the Born-linearized subsurface scattering model via object-based curve evolution (CE) techniques. This frequency domain (FD) strategy implements a further step in our planned sequential approach toward a physics based, robust, and numerically efficient framework for rough surface underground imaging in both FD and time domain (TD). Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed framework is attractive from both computational and robustness viewpoints. The results in this paper could also be used for synthesis of TD illumination (in a previous study [Galdi et al., 2001b], we have dealt with wideband illumination directly in the TD).},

abstract={We develop a Gabor-based Gaussian beam (GB) algorithm for representing two-dimensional (2-D) radiation from finite aperture distributions with short-pulse excitation in the time domain (TD). The work extends previous results using 2-D frequency-domain (FD) narrow-waisted Gaussian beams. The FD algorithm evolves from the rigorous Kirchhoff integration over the aperture distribution, which is then parameterized via the discrete Gabor basis and evaluated asymptotically for high frequencies to furnish the GB propagators to the observer. The TD results are obtained by Fourier inversion from the FD and yield pulsed beams (PB). We describe the resulting TD algorithm for several aperture distributions, ranging from simple linearly phased (linear delay) to arbitrary time delay profiles; the latter accommodate the important case of focusing TD aperture fields. For modulated pulses with Gaussian envelopes, we compute accurate closed form analytic solutions, which have been calibrated against numerical reference data. Our results confirm that the previously established utility of the Gabor-based narrow-waisted FD-GB algorithm for radiation from distributed apertures remains intact in the TD},

abstract={Gabor-based Gaussian beam (GB) algorithms, in conjunction with the complex source point (CSP) method for generating beam-like wave objects, have found application in a variety of high-frequency wave propagation and diffraction scenarios. Of special interest for efficient numerical implementation is the noncollimated narrow-waisted species of GB, which reduces the computationally intensive complex ray tracing for collimated GB propagation and scattering to quasi-real ray tracing, without the failure of strictly real ray field algorithms in caustic and other transition regions. The Gabor-based narrow-waisted CSP-GB method has been applied previously to two-dimensional (2-D) propagation from extended nonfocused and focused aperture distributions through arbitrarily curved 2-D layered environments. In this 2-D study the method is applied to aperture-excited field scattering from, and transmission through, a moderately rough interface between two dielectric media. It is shown that the algorithm produces accurate and computationally efficient solutions for this complex propagation environment, over a range of calibrated combinations of the problem parameters. One of the potential uses of the algorithm is as an efficient forward solver for inverse problems concerned with profile and object reconstruction},

abstract={A general numerical algorithm for the computation of the fundamental modes and related cutoff wavenumbers in arbitrary shaped inhomogeneous waveguides is presented. The method exploits a generalized Donsker-Kac formula to express the lowest order modes in terms of asymptotic generalized Wiener-Ito integrals, whose computation is carried out by means of Monte Carlo methods. Comparison with known solutions and computational budget indicate that the proposed method is indeed accurate, versatile, as well as computationally efficient},

The computation of the involved functional (path) integrals is accomplished by means of a reduced-variance Monte Carlo method.
