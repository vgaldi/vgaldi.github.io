  For dielectric multilayered metamaterials, the effective-parameter representation is known to be insensitive to geometrical features occurring at deeply subwavelength scales. However, recent studies on periodic and aperiodically ordered geometries have shown the existence of certain critical parameter regimes where this conventional wisdom is upended, as the optical response of finite-size samples may depart considerably from the predictions of standard effective-medium theory. In these regimes, characterized by a mixed evanescent/propagating light transport, different classes of spatial (dis)order have been shown to induce distinctive effects in the optical response, in terms of anomalous transmission, localization, enhancement, absorption, and lasing. Here we further expand these examples by considering a quasiperiodic scenario based on a modified-Fibonacci geometry. Among the intriguing features of this model there is the presence of a scale parameter that controls the transition from perfectly periodic to quasiperiodic scenarios of different shades. Via an extensive parametric study, this allows us to identify the quasiperiodicity-induced anomalous effects, and to elucidate certain distinctive mechanisms and footprints. Our results hold potentially interesting implications for the optical probing of structural features at a resolution much smaller than the wavelength, and could also be leveraged to design novel types of absorbers and low-threshold lasers.

Here, we introduce and explore a non-Hermitian platform supporting these exotic modes based on parity−time symmetry. Speciﬁcally, we show that line waves can occur in the presence of a uniform surface reactance (either capacitive or inductive) and a symmetric resistance discontinuity from negative to positive values (i.e., gain and loss). We study analytically and numerically the propagation properties of these waves and the underlying physical mechanisms and also illustrate their intriguing properties in terms of conﬁnement, reconﬁgurability, spin-momentum locking and lasing. Finally, we address possible practical implementations based on photoexcited graphene. Our results hold intriguing potentials for applications in ﬂat optics and reconﬁgurable photonics.

  The steadily increasing demand for accurate analysis of vitamin D level, via measurement of its best general marker, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), pushes for the development of novel automated assays capable of working at very low concentrations. Here, we propose a plasmonic biosensor of 25(OH)D3 (calcifediol) based on surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, which exploits the resonant coupling between plasmonic nanoantennas and vibrational excitation of small molecules. Specifically, our proposed platform features a large-area (several mm2) metasurface made of gold nanoantennas fabricated on a silicon substrate, comprising different macroregions (“pixels”) of area 500 × 500 µm2. In each pixel, the nanoantenna geometrical parameters are tuned so as to support localized surface plasmon resonances (and hence large field enhancements at the nanoscale) within different regions of the infrared spectrum.

So far, this phenomenon has been studied mostly for lossless configurations. In principle, the inevitable presence of material losses can be compensated via optical gain. However, taking inspiration from quantum (e.g., parity-time) symmetries that are eliciting growing attention in the emerging fields of non-Hermitian optics and photonics, this suggests considering more general gain-loss interactions. Here, we theoretically show that the photonic doping concept can be extended to non-Hermitian scenarios characterized by tailored distributions of gain and loss in either the doping particles or the host medium. In these scenarios, the effective permeability can be modeled as a complex-valued quantity (with the imaginary part accounting for the gain or loss), which can be tailored over broad regions of the complex plane. This enables a variety of unconventional optical responses and waveguiding mechanisms, which can be, in principle, reconfigured by varying the optical gain (e.g., via optical pumping). We envision several possible applications of this concept, including reconfigurable nanophotonics platforms and optical sensing, which motivate further studies for their experimental validation.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, this concept has been translated to two-dimensional photonic scenarios in connection with host media characterized by vanishingly small relative permittivity (epsilon near zero), showing that it is possible to obtain broadly tunable effective magnetic responses by introducing a single, nonmagnetic doping particle at an arbitrary position. So far, this phenomenon has been studied mostly for lossless configurations. In principle, the inevitable presence of material losses can be compensated via optical gain. However, taking inspiration from quantum (e.g., parity-time) symmetries that are eliciting growing attention in the emerging fields of non-Hermitian optics and photonics, this suggests considering more general gain-loss interactions. Here, we theoretically show that the photonic doping concept can be extended to non-Hermitian scenarios characterized by tailored distributions of gain and loss in either the doping particles or the host medium. In these scenarios, the effective permeability can be modeled as a complex-valued quantity (with the imaginary part accounting for the gain or loss), which can be tailored over broad regions of the complex plane. This enables a variety of unconventional optical responses and waveguiding mechanisms, which can be, in principle, reconfigured by varying the optical gain (e.g., via optical pumping). We envision several possible applications of this concept, including reconfigurable nanophotonics platforms and optical sensing, which motivate further studies for their experimental validation.
