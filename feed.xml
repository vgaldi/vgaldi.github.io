Felsen Award for Excellence in Electrodynamics&lt;/em&gt; is open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Award was originally established jointly by the University of Siena and the University of Sannio, 
funded through a donation from Michael and Judy Felsen in fulfillment of the last wishes of their father, 
Professor Leo Felsen (1924-2005). Since 2015, the Award is established by the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.euraap.org&quot;&gt;European Association on Antennas and Propagation&lt;/a&gt; (EurAAP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the Award is to keep alive Prof. Felsen’s memory and scientific legacy, 
as well as to foster academic excellence in the electromagnetics community, 
by giving recognition to outstanding fundamental contributions from early stage researchers in electrodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Award, by nomination only, will be presented annually, as a career award, to an early stage researcher. 
Eligible nominees should be under 40 years of age at the submission deadline. 
Previous awardees (also from the former Sannio and Siena editions) are not eligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Award consists of a prize of 4,000 euro, which will be funded by the Felsen Family through a donation, 
and will be officially presented at the banquet of the upcoming 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eucap2020.org&quot;&gt;14th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation&lt;/a&gt; (EuCAP 2020).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Candidates from all areas of Electromagnetics are eligible to apply. 
Selection will be based on quality and significance of the candidates’ contributions to the field, and on the 
recommendation of the referees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline for submission of the nominations is &lt;strong&gt;January 31, 2020&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  Metasurfaces are artificially engineered ultrathin structures that can finely tailor and control electromagnetic wavefronts. There is currently a strong interest in exploring their capability to lift some fundamental limitations dictated by Lorentz reciprocity, which have strong implications in communication, heat management, and energy harvesting. Time-varying approaches have emerged as attractive alternatives to conventional schemes relying on magnetic or nonlinear materials, but experimental evidence is currently limited to devices such as circulators and antennas. Here, the recently proposed concept of space-time-coding digital metasurfaces is leveraged to break reciprocity. Moreover, it is shown that such nonreciprocal effects can be controlled dynamically. This approach relies on inducing suitable spatiotemporal phase gradients in a programmable way via digital modulation of the metasurface-elements’ phase repsonse, which enable anomalous reflections accompanied by frequency conversions. A prototype operating at microwave frequencies is designed and fabricated for proof-of-concept validation. Measured results are in good agreement with theory, hence providing the first experimental evidence of nonreciprocal reflection effects enabled by space-time-modulated digital metasurfaces. The proposed concept and platform set the stage for “on-demand” realization of nonreciprocal effects, in programmable or reconfigurable fashions, which may find several promising applications, including frequency conversion, Doppler frequency illusion, optical isolation, and unidirectional transmission.

  Metasurfaces are artificially engineered ultrathin structures that can finely tailor and control electromagnetic wavefronts. There is currently a strong interest in exploring their capability to lift some fundamental limitations dictated by Lorentz reciprocity, which have strong implications in communication, heat management, and energy harvesting. Time-varying approaches have emerged as attractive alternatives to conventional schemes relying on magnetic or nonlinear materials, but experimental evidence is currently limited to devices such as circulators and antennas. Here, the recently proposed concept of space-time-coding digital metasurfaces is leveraged to break reciprocity. Moreover, it is shown that such nonreciprocal effects can be controlled dynamically. This approach relies on inducing suitable spatiotemporal phase gradients in a programmable way via digital modulation of the metasurface-elements’ phase repsonse, which enable anomalous reflections accompanied by frequency conversions. A prototype operating at microwave frequencies is designed and fabricated for proof-of-concept validation. Measured results are in good agreement with theory, hence providing the first experimental evidence of nonreciprocal reflection effects enabled by space-time-modulated digital metasurfaces. The proposed concept and platform set the stage for “on-demand” realization of nonreciprocal effects, in programmable or reconfigurable fashions, which may find several promising applications, including frequency conversion, Doppler frequency illusion, optical isolation, and unidirectional transmission.

  Non-Hermitian systems characterized by suitable spatial distributions of gain and loss can exhibit “spectral singularities” in the form of zero-width resonances associated to real-frequency poles in the scattering operator. Here, we study this intriguing phenomenon in connection with cylindrical geometries, and explore possible applications to controlling and tailoring in unconventional ways the scattering response of sub-wavelength and wavelength-sized objects. Among the possible implications and applications, we illustrate the additional degrees of freedom available in the scattering-absorption-extinction tradeoff, and address the engineering of zero-forward-scattering, transverse scattering, and gain-controlled reconfigurability of the scattering pattern, also paying attention to stability issues. Our results may open up new vistas in active and reconfigurable nanophotonics platforms.
