  Transformation optics asks, using Maxwell’s equations, what kind of electromagnetic medium recreates some smooth deformation of space? The guiding principle is Einstein’s principle of covariance: that any physical theory must take the same form in any coordinate system. This requirement fixes very precisely the required electromagnetic medium. The impact of this insight cannot be overestimated. Many practitioners were used to thinking that only a few analytic solutions to Maxwell’s equations existed, such as the monochromatic plane wave in a homogeneous, isotropic medium. At a stroke, transformation optics increases that landscape from ‘few’ to ‘infinity’, and to each of the infinitude of analytic solutions dreamt up by the researcher, there corresponds an electromagnetic medium capable of reproducing that solution precisely. The most striking example is the electromagnetic cloak, thought to be an unreachable dream of science fiction writers, but realised in the laboratory a few months after the papers proposing the possibility were published. But the practical challenges are considerable, requiring meta-media that are at once electrically and magnetically inhomogeneous and anisotropic. How far have we come since the first demonstrations over a decade ago? And what does the future hold? If the wizardry of perfect macroscopic optical invisibility still eludes us in practice, then what compromises still enable us to create interesting, useful, devices? While three-dimensional (3D) cloaking remains a significant technical challenge, much progress has been made in two dimensions. Carpet cloaking, wherein an object is hidden under a surface that appears optically flat, relaxes the constraints of extreme electromagnetic parameters. Surface wave cloaking guides sub-wavelength surface waves, making uneven surfaces appear flat. Two dimensions is also the setting in which conformal and complex coordinate transformations are realisable, and the possibilities in this restricted domain do not appear to have been exhausted yet. Beyond cloaking, the enhanced electromagnetic landscape provided by transformation optics has shown how fully analytic solutions can be found to a number of physical scenarios such as plasmonic systems used in electron energy loss spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence. Are there further fields to be enriched? A new twist to transformation optics was the extension to the spacetime domain. By applying transformations to spacetime, rather than just space, it was shown that events rather than objects could be hidden from view; transformation optics had provided a means of effectively redacting events from history. The hype quickly settled into serious nonlinear optical experiments that demonstrated the soundness of the idea, and it is now possible to consider the practical implications, particularly in optical signal processing, of having an ‘interrupt-without-interrupt’ facility that the so-called temporal cloak provides.

Felsen Award for Excellence in Electrodynamics&lt;/em&gt; is open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Award was originally established jointly by the University of Siena and the University of Sannio, 
funded through a donation from Michael and Judy Felsen in fulfillment of the last wishes of their father, 
Professor Leo Felsen (1924-2005). Since 2015, the Award is established by the 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.euraap.org&quot;&gt;European Association on Antennas and Propagation&lt;/a&gt; (EurAAP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the Award is to keep alive Prof. Felsen’s memory and scientific legacy, 
as well as to foster academic excellence in the electromagnetics community, 
by giving recognition to outstanding fundamental contributions from early stage researchers in electrodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Award, by nomination only, will be presented annually, as a career award, to an early stage researcher. 
Eligible nominees should be under 40 years of age at the submission deadline. 
Previous awardees (also from the former Sannio and Siena editions) are not eligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Award consists of a prize of 4,000 euro, which will be funded by the Felsen Family through a donation, 
and will be officially presented at the banquet of the upcoming 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eucap2018.org&quot;&gt;12th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation&lt;/a&gt; (EuCAP 2018).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Candidates from all areas of Electromagnetics are eligible to apply. 
Selection will be based on quality and significance of the candidates’ contributions to the field, and on the 
recommendation of the referees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deadline for submission of the nominations is &lt;strong&gt;January 31, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
