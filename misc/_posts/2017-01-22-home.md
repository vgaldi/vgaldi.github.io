The Fields & Waves Lab at the University of Sannio works at the boundary of physics and engineering. 
We study fundamental physical aspects of **wave propagation** in complex media and scenarios, 
and explore engineering applications to **communications and sensing**.

We are expecially interested in metamaterials, aperiodic order, ray chaos, and gravitational interferometry.
