Our paper on "Enhancement and interplay of first- and second-order spatial 
dispersion in metamaterials with moderate-permittivity inclusions,"
in collaboration with [Carlo Rizza] (University of l'Aquila) and [Alessandro Ciattoni] (CNR-SPIN),
has been accepted for publication as a Rapid Communication in [*Physical Review B*](https://journals.aps.org/prb/). 

An [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06510) is available.
