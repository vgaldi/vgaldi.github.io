Our paper on "Exceptional points of degeneracy and PT-symmetry in photonic coupled chains of scatterers," 
in collaboration with [Filippo Capolino]'s Group (University of California at Irvine),
has been accepted for publication in [*Physical Review B*](https://journals.aps.org/prb/). 

An [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00414) is available.
