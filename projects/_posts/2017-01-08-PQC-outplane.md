Our Group has been among the first to study the *out-of-plane* properties of photonic quasicrystals.

In a series of studies in collaboration with [Andrea Cusano]'s Group (University of Sannio),
we have investigated the *guided resonances* that can be excited 
in a dielectric photonic quasicrystal slabs. 
More specifically, in [{% cite IJ66_OpEx_17_6335_2009 %}, {% cite IJ79_MOTL_51_2737_2009 %}], 
via a full-wave numerical study of the transmittance response and the modal structure of a photonic quasicrystal 
slab based on a representative aperiodic geometry (Ammann-Beenker octagonal tiling), 
we demonstrated the possibility to excite guided-resonance modes, 
and highlighted similarities and differences with the periodic case. 
In particular, we showed that, as for the periodic case, guided resonances 
arise from the coupling of the incident plane-wave with degenerate modes of the photonic quasicrystal 
slab that exhibit a matching symmetry in the spatial distribution, 
and can still be parameterized via a Fano-like model.
In [{% cite IJ76_OpEx_17_19586_2009 %}], with reference to the same geometry,
we studied the effects induced by the introduction of 
symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking point defects. 
Our results demonstrated that breaking the supercell mirror symmetries via the 
judicious introduction of point-defects enables for the excitation of otherwise uncoupled guided resonances, 
with control on the symmetry properties of their field distributions, 
thereby constituting an attractive alternative to those guided-resonance-engineering approaches 
based on the asymmetrization of the hole shape. 
In [{% cite IJ88_OpEx_18_17280_2010 %}], we carried out a comparative study of the tuning efficiency and sensitivity 
of guided resonances. These results indicated that the spatial arrangement of the 
holes may strongly influence the tuning and sensitivity efficiency, 
and may provide new degrees of freedom and tools for the design and optimization of 
novel photonic devices for both sensing and telecommunication applications.

In [{% cite IJ90_OL_35_3946_2010 %}, {% cite IJ95_PRB_84_085135_2011 %}], in collaboration with [Thomas Krauss]'Group 
(University of St. Andrews), we provided the first experimental evidence of Fano-type guided resonances 
in aperiodically-ordered photonic quasicrystal slabs.
The figure top panel shows a scanning-electron-microscope of 
the silicon-on-insulator prototype (operating at near-infrared wavelengths). The bottom panel shows the measured 
reflectance response, from which a Fano-type resonant lineshape is clearly visible, in good agreement with
numerical simulations.
 
In [{% cite IJ102_AFM_22_4389_2012 %}], we considered hybrid metallo-dielectric 
quasicrystal nanostructures composed of metal-backed aperiodically patterned low-contrast dielectric layers.
We showed that, by comparison with standard periodic structures, a 
moderately richer spectrum of resonant modes may
be excited, due to the easier achievement of phase-matching conditions endowed by its denser Bragg spectrum. 
Such modes are characterized by a distinctive plasmonic or photonic behavior, discriminated by their field distribution 
and dependence on the metal film thickness. 
The enhanced capability of quasicrystals to control number, spectral position, and 
mode distribution of hybrid resonances may be exploited in a variety of possible applications. 
In particular, we assessed the surface sensitivity with respect to nanosized deposition of SiO overlays 
(for response tuning/optimization), and SiO2 overlays (with refractive index resembling that of biological molecules). 
The proposed metallo-dielectric quasicrystal nanostructures exhibit remarkably high surface sensitivity, 
namely, âˆ¼0.4 nm wavelength shift per nanometer of deposited SiO2 overlay, with an enhancement of 50% with 
respect to the plasmonic resonances in the periodic counterpart. 
By acting on the extra degrees of freedom typical of quasicrystals, 
there exist further margins of optimization for the surface sensitivity, 
and therefore concrete perspectives to outperform photonic-crystal-based chemical and 
biological sensors based on periodic nanostructures currently available on the market.
