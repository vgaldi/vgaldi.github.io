Other intriguing examples of ray chaos can be found in *open* configurations such as (n>3)-disk “pinballs”, 
or appropriately configured inhomogeneous refractive media with ray-trapping properties.  


In [{% cite IJ29_IEEE_TAP_53_753_2005 %}], 
in collaboration with the late Prof. [Leo Felsen] (Boston University),
we 
studied a two-dimensional test example of such an environment 
which embodies intimately coupled refractive wave-trapping and periodicity-induced multiple 
scattering phenomenologies, and which is amenable to explicit full-wave analysis. 
Though strictly nonchaotic, we demonstrated that under appropriate conditions 
the high-frequency wave dynamics exhibits 
trends toward irregularity and other peculiar characteristics; 
these features can be interpreted as “ray-chaotic footprints”, and they are usually not observed 
in geometries characterized by “regular” ray behavior.

In [{% cite IJ57_IEEE_TAP_56_2638_2008 %}], we extended this study to
a cylindrical scatterer made of a perfectly electric-conducting azimuthally corrugated boundary 
coated by a radially inhomogeneous (ray-trapping) dielectric layer, as shown in the figure (top panel).
We showed that, for such configuration, ray dynamics is generally of “mixed type,” with the presence 
of both regular and chaotic regions in the phase space. It is possible to “tune” the 
parameter configuration (e.g., acting on the refractive index gradient) so as to render the dynamics strongly chaotic. 

By relying on a full-wave solution (via a problem-matched semi-analytic technique), we studied
the monostatic (i.e., observed at backscattering direction) radar-cross-section (RCS) response, 
for ﬁxed incidence angle and various parametric conﬁgurations ranging from regular to chaotic ray dynamics, 
for various representative frequency and incidence conditions. 
As illustrated in the figure bottom panels, starting from the fairly regular response of a plain circular cylinder, 
it is observed how introducing either corrugations or graded-index-coating alone 
(i.e., preserving the ray-regular behavior) produces only smooth changes or the appearance of isolated peaks. 
Conversely, introducing both corrugation and graded-index-coating (which are both required for the onset of ray-chaos) 
produces increasingly complex RCS responses. In particular, the conﬁguration corresponding to ray-chaotic dynamics  
exhibits a monostatic RCS response with very rapid and irregular frequency variations, and 
wide (up to three orders of magnitude) dynamic ranges.

Our results clearly indicate that electrically large ray-chaotically inclined conﬁgurations 
exhibit fairly complex monostatic and bistatic RCS responses, characterized by wide dynamic ranges 
and strong sensitivity on the frequency and incidence direction, which are fairly different 
from those observed in ray-regular conﬁgurations. Particularly intriguing from the application viewpoint 
is the possible exploitation of the inherent richness and complexity of the RCS signatures 
 in radar-counter-measure scenarios.
