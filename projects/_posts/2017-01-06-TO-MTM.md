Transformation optics has been a major catalyst for the formidable advances 
in the field of electromagnetic metamaterials, by providing a systematic and 
versatile tool for the conception and design of artificial media with given field-manipulation 
capabilities. In essence, by exploiting the form-invariance of Maxwell’s equations with 
respect to coordinate transformations, transformation optics allows us to systematically 
tailor the spatial constitutive profile of a material so as to precisely manipulate the field distribution 
and propagation according to a given coordinate-distorted reference frame. 
The implied paradigm shift is the separation of the conceptual design from the actual material synthesis, 
with the former essentially driven by geometrical intuition and considerations, and the latter reducing 
to a suitable approximation of given ideal constitutive “blueprints.”

It is well known that the *inherently magnetic* properties of typically arising transformation media 
limit the high-frequency scaling of practical metamaterial implementations based on subwavelength inclusions 
(e.g., split-ring resonators). In [{% cite IJ62_MOTL_50_3186_2008 %}, {% cite IJ74_PRB_80_125116_2009 %}], with reference to 
the “invisibility cloaking” scenario, we explored 
alternative approaches to attain *nonmagnetic* implementations, 
with performance comparable to that of a nonideal  lossy, dispersive, 
parameter truncated  implementation of standard  magnetic  cloaking.


In [{% cite IJ60_IEEE_AWPL_7_603_2008 %}, {% cite IJ78_MOTL_51_2709_2009 %}], 
we applied the transformation approach to corner- and wedge-type configurations, in order to attain
unconventional scattering signatures, whereas, in [{% cite IJ83_PRB_81_125124_2010 %}], we explored a general 
class of transparent metamaterial slabs with intriguing image-displacement/formation capabilities. For instance, the figure 
top panels illustrate the design of a coordinate transformation capable of “flattening” a corner-reflector geometry, 
thereby yielding a thin planar metamaterial-based retroreflector.
The bottom panels show the numerically computed scattering response for oblique (15°) plane-wave incidence, 
comparing the proposed retroreflector to a standard corner reflector and a plain metal sheet.
The retrodirective response of the proposed reﬂector is clearly visible from the wavefront shapes, 
in complete accord with those observed in the corner-reﬂector case, and in sharp contrast with 
those observed in the plain-metal-sheet (which instead exhibits a strong specular response).

In [{% cite IJ65_OpEx_17_3101_2009 %}], we studied the interactions between an invisibility cloak
and an “anti-cloak” capable  of (partially or totally) “undoing” the cloaking transformation. 
In [{% cite IJ89_JOSAB_27_2132_2010%}, {% cite IJ94_WM_48_455_2011 %}], we further developed this concept, 
and illustrated its possible applications to the design of “invisible” sensors. 

In [{% cite IJ92_JO_13_024011_2011 %}], we extended the approach to
deal with *single-negative*  materials, and applied this concept to the design of
tunneling effects.

More recently, we have applied the transformation-optics approach to the design of metamaterial radomes for extending 
the scanning angle of a phased array [{% cite IJ126_IEEE-JMMCT_2017 %}].

We have also proposed other extensions to deal with [nonlocal], [non-Hermitian], and [multiphysics] scenarios, 
some of which are also included in a recent “roadmap” [{% cite IJ129_JO_20_063001_2018 %}] .
