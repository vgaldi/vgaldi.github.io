Metamaterials can give rise to a broad variety of *anomalous* transmission effects.
For instance, it is well known that, in spite of their inherent opacity, slabs of (homogeneous, isotropic) 
epsilon-negative and mu-negative media can give rise to resonant tunneling phenomena 
(with total transmission and zero phase delay) when paired as a bilayer. 
Starting from this basic configuration, several extensions and generalizations can be investigated.

In [{% cite IJ93_PRB_83_081105_2011 %}], 
in collaboration with 
[Nader Engheta] (University of Pennsylvania) 
and [Andrea Alù] (University of Texas at Austin), 
we studied another counterintuitive resonant tunneling mechanism, 
which entails pairing an epsilon-negative slab with a bilayer made of *double-positive* 
(i.e., positive-permittivity and permeability) media. In particular, one of the two double-positive media 
can be chosen arbitrarily (even vacuum), while the other may exhibit extreme (either near-zero or very high) 
permittivity and permeability values. Our results on this counterintuitive tunneling phenomenon also 
demonstrate the possibility of synthesizing double-positive slabs that effectively exhibit 
epsilon/mu-negative-like wave-impedance properties within a moderately wide frequency range.
In [{% cite IJ97_JOSAB_28_2632_2011 %}], 
we considered a different configuration featuring a homogeneous, isotropic epsilon-negative slab 
paired with a uniaxially anisotropic double-positive slab, under obliquely incident illumination. 
Unlike the Fabry–Perot-type resonant phenomena observed in the previous configuration (characterized
by standing waves in the double-positive layers and a nonzero phase delay), 
the resonant phenomena in the proposed configuration are mediated by the excitation of localized surface modes at 
the interface, are characterized by zero phase delay, and they depend on the slab thickness ratio (rather than sum), i
n a much closer analogy with what observed in the matched epsilon/mu-negative bilayers. 
This allows us to establish a more direct and physically incisive analogy between the uniaxial-double-positive
slab and a matched (homogeneous, isotropic) epsilon/mu-negative slab, respectively.

Another intriguing phenomenon is the so called “extraordinary optical transmission”, i.e., 
the possibility of achieving strong enhancements in the transmission of electromagnetic
fields through arrays of sub-wavelength holes or slits in metallic screens 
 with respect to the very low levels predicted by the well-known Bethe’s theory. 

In collaboration with [Antonello Andreone]'s Group (“Federico II” University of Naples), 
we demonstrated (numerically and experimentally) the possibility of achieving substantial enhancements in the 
transmission of transverse-electric-polarized electromagnetic fields through subwavelength slits 
in a thin metallic screen by placing single or paired metallic cut-wire arrays at a close distance from the screen.
More specifically, in [{% cite IJ87_IEEE_AWPL_9_641_2010 %}], we carried out a comprehensive numerical study,
which indicated that a richer phenomenology (involving both electric-and magnetic-type resonances) 
could be attained by pairing a two cut-wire arrays at the two sides of the screen.
Subsequently, in [{% cite IJ91_OpEx_18_26769_2010 %}], we reported on the first experimental evidence of 
such extraordinary transmission phenomena, via microwave (X/Ku-band) measurements on printed-circuit-board prototypes.
The figure top panel schematizes the geometry of interes, whereas the center panel shows the fabricated prototype. 
The bottom panel shows instead the microwave measurements.
A resonance peak is clearly visible around 14.4 GHz, with an intensity reaching nearly 80% of the full transmission, 
i.e., about 910-times stronger than the response attainable in the absence of the cut-wire arrays. 
Our results, in very good agreement with the full-wave numerical predictions, also
reveal a remarkable robustness of these phenomena with respect to fabrication tolerances and experimental 
imperfections (misalignments, edge effects, etc.), and confirm the intriguing design potentials envisaged 
in the previous numerical studies.
