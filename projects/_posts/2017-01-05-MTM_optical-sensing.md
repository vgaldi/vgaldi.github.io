Metamaterials and artificial materials can find important applications to optical sensing.
In collaboration with [Andrea Cusano]'s Group (University of Sannio), we have explored 
several nanostructured configurations for label-free biosensing. 

In [{% cite IJ106_OpEx_21_23531_2013 %}], we studied
sensing schemes based on Rayleigh anomalies in 
metal nanogratings. These structures tend to exhibit an impressive bulk refractive-index sensitivity determined 
solely by the grating period. However, the surface sensitivity (which is a key figure of merit 
for label-free chemical and biological sensing) needs to be carefully investigated to assess the 
actual applicability of this technological platform. Accordingly, we studied the wavelength shift induced by
thin dielectric overlays.
Our studies revealed that the surface sensitivity deteriorates up to two orders of magnitude 
by comparison with the corresponding bulk value; interestingly, this residual sensitivity is 
not attributable to the wavelength shift of the Rayleigh anomalies, which are completely insensitive to local 
refractive-index changes, but rather to a strictly connected plasmonic effect. Our analysis for 
increasing overlay thickness revealed an ultimate surface sensitivity that approaches the Rayleigh-anomaly bulk value, 
which turns out to be the upper-limit of grating-assisted surface-plasmon-polariton sensitivities.


As the field of plasmonics has reached the “slope of enlightenment”, consensus 
is generally growing on the quest for alternative low-loss materials and related mechanisms.
Bloch surface waves constitute an attractive alternative for applications to
label-free biosensing.
These waves are guided at the interface between a homogeneous medium and a truncated one-dimensional photonic crystal, 
and are characterized by a dispersion curve located in the forbidden band of the photonic crystal.
In [{% cite IJ122_OpEx_24_27771_2016 %}], we investigated the possibility to excite 
Bloch surface waves on the tip of single-mode optical fibers. 
The figure top panel schematizes the proposed excitation scheme, based on a grating-coupling mechanism, 
which enables an efficient control of the excitation angle combined with a feasible integration on the tip 
of an optical fiber.
The bottom panels show the attained resonant field distribution and lineshape.
Our results indicated that the attained sensitivities are in line with those exhibited by state-of-the-art 
plasmonic bioprobes, with the key advantage of exhibiting much narrower spectral resonances. 
This prototype study paves the way for a new class of miniaturized high-performance surface-wave 
fiber-optic devices for high-resolution label-free optical biosensing, and represents an important step 
forward in the “lab-on-fiber” technology roadmap.
More recently [{% cite IJ130_AdOM_2018 %}], we have experimentally validated the above results, by demonstrating fro the first time  
the excitation of Bloch surface waves on the tip of an optical fiber.

In a separate but related project, we have also explored the sensing capabilities of optical-fiber [meta-tips].
