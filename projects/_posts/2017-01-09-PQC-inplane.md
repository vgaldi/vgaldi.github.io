Photonic crystals are artificial materials capable of exhibiting photonic bandgaps, 
which have drawn a considerable interest from the electromagnetic community, 
in view of the peculiar filtering and radiating effects attainable through their utilization. 
Classic designs are based on *periodic* (possibly defected) metallic or dielectric inclusions 
in a suitable host medium, and their rotational symmetries are accordingly bounded by the so-called 
“crystallographic restriction”. The discovery in solid-state physics of “quasicrystals”, 
i.e., certain metallic alloys exhibiting X-ray diffraction spectra with “non-crystallographic” 
[e.g., 5-fold or (n>6)-fold] symmetries that are known to be incompatible with spatial periodicity, 
has opened up intriguing perspectives toward aperiodic photonic quasicrystals. 

In a series of studies in collaboration with [Stefan Enoch], [Gérard Tayeb] (Fresnel Institute) and [Filippo Capolino] 
(University of California at Irvine), we have investigated several properties of the *in-plane* response of these structures.
More specifically, in [{% cite IJ31_PRL_94_183903_2005 %}, {% cite IJ38_IEEE_AWPL_5_331_2006 %}], we studied 
the bandgap formation in representative categories of photonic quasicrystals. 
We showed that, among the bandgaps, some exhibit a behavior similar to that typical of (periodic) photonic crystals, 
while others do not. The development of certain band gaps requires large-size quasicrystals. 
This is explained by the long-range interactions involved in their formation. 
Moreover, the frequencies where the bandgaps occur are not necessarily explained using single 
scattering and should therefore involve multiple scattering.

In [{% cite IJ36_OpEx_14_10021_2006 %}], we investigated 
the properties of the resonant modes that occur in the transparency bands of two-dimensional 
finite-size Penrose-type photonic quasicrystals made of dielectric cylindrical rods. 
These modes stem from the natural local arrangements of the quasicrystal structure rather than, 
as originally thought, from fabrication-related imperfections. 
We showed that these modes mainly originate from the 
interactions between a limited numbers of rods.

In [{% cite IJ64_PRB_79_075110_2009 %}], we studied 
the radiation from embedded sources in two-dimensional finite-size photonic-quasicrystal 
slabs made of dielectric rods arranged according to a 12-fold symmetric aperiodic tiling. 
Our results indicated the possibility of achieving broadside radiation at multiple frequencies, 
with high directivity (e.g., 15 dB) and low sidelobes (e.g., -12 dB). 
We also showed that leaky waves are supported by such slabs and that the beamwidth 
is directly proportional to the leaky wave attenuation constant.


In [{% cite IJ59_APL_93_164102_2008 %}, {% cite IJ80_NJP_11_113022_2009 %}], in collaboration with 
[Antonello Andreone]'s Group (“Federico II” University of Naples), we 
studied the confinement properties of point-defect resonators 
in finite-size photonic-quasiscrystal structures composed of aperiodic arrangements 
of dielectric rods, with special emphasis on their use for the design of cavities for particle accelerators. 
We also highlighted the possible advantages of using hybrid structures based on the above dielectric configurations, 
but featuring metallic rods in the outermost regions, for the design of extremely high quality factor, 
bandgap-based, accelerating resonators. 
Moreover, we also explored possible improvements attainable via the use of superconducting plates to 
confine the electromagnetic field in the longitudinal direction.

In [{% cite IJ52_PNFA_6_1_2008 %}, {% cite IJ54_PRB_77_193104_2008 %}], 
we studied the refraction and focusing properties of dodecagonal photonic quasicrystals, 
via both full-wave numerical simulations and microwave measurements on a slab made of alumina rods 
inserted in a parallel-plate waveguide. 
The 12-fold-symmetric tiling geometry was generated via the Stamplfi inflation rules shown 
in the figure top panel. The center panel shows the experimental setup for the microwave (X-band) measurements.
The bottom panel shows the simulated and measured ﬁeld intensity maps at 8.836 GHz, 
illustrating the focusing of a source placed symmetrically at a distance of 6 cm from the slab surface.
A very good agreement between simulations and experiments can be observed.
Our interpretation, substantially differs from the one in terms of “effective negative refractive index” 
that was originally proposed by other Groups. 
Instead, our study highlights the critical role played by short-range interactions associated with local order and symmetry.
